<h1>Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard Automation</h1>
<p>
  This project focuses on analyzing a large sales dataset and automating the delivery of key business insights through a dynamic Power BI dashboard. 
  The primary objective was to streamline the data analysis process, transforming raw data into actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making for the sales team.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  The project involved working with a comprehensive sales dataset provided as a MySQL database dump. 
  Using a combination of SQL and Power BI, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to unlock hidden sales insights. 
  The end result was an automated dashboard that delivers quick, accurate, and up-to-date sales metrics.
